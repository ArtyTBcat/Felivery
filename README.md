# ตี้ตี้ (Ti-Ti)

ตี้ตี้(Ti-Ti) or Ti is an automated delivery system developed by a small high-school team that can deliver packages anywhere in the world within 24 hours! The Delivery Robot is equipped with a high quality camera and GPS tracking device that allows it to navigate its way through any obstacle or terrain.

Delivery Robot is an autonomous mobile robot developed by a small high-school students. The robot can navigate autonomously through indoor or outdoor environments using its onboard sensors and cameras. It has been used as a testbed for developing new technologies such as navigation algorithms, perception systems, and control software.

* High quality camera and GPS tracker * Can navigate through any obstacle or terrain * Can be controlled remotely via smartphone or pre-program via an app
* Can be programmed to follow a specific route * Can be used as a mobile office * Can be used for deliveries of lage cargo items such as boxes, cargo, groceries, etc.
